# Personal Portfolio

### This repository contains the source code for my personal developer portfolio website. Built with `React JS`, `Tailwind CSS`, `GSAP`, `Lenis` the portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and professional background in a clean, Modern and responsive design.

The site includes sections for an breif introduction, featured works with live previews, skillsets, and contact information. It is fully responsive across devices and optimized for performance and accessibility with modern animations and transitions . This portfolio acts as my digital presence to connect with potential employers, collaborators, and the developer community.
